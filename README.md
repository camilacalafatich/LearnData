# ðŸ§½ Data Cleaning | E-Learning

In this project, we will delve into data analysis at LearnData, a leading e-learning company specializing in the sale of online data analysis courses.

# Context:

LearnData is embarking on the journey of constructing a robust technological infrastructure to analyze their data effectively. The primary goal is to clean and prepare the data for consumption by various business units. LearnData relies on the following tools to manage its operations:

* WooCommerce: A WordPress plugin that transforms a website into an e-commerce platform, facilitating the sale of products.

* Stripe: An online payment processing platform, similar to PayPal.

* WordPress: A popular Content Management System (CMS) used for building, modifying, and maintaining websites, powering a significant share of the internet.

LearnData's objective is to initiate the analysis of their key financial metrics, but they lack a pre-established system for capturing, analyzing, and making informed decisions.

# Tasks:

* Create the customer database from raw data.
* Establish the order database from raw data.
* Develop the Stripe payment database from raw data.

# Tools to Be Utilized:

We will employ SQL to construct the database and perform data cleaning.
